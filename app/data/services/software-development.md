Sofgen offers comprehensive software development services tailored to meet the specific needs of clients. The software development process is divided into several phases, focusing on delivering high-quality software according to customer requirements.

For example, if a restaurant wishes to develop an online food ordering app, the process begins with Requirement Gathering. The restaurant owner will meet with the software development team to discuss their needs, such as enabling customers to browse the menu, place orders, and make payments online. Next, the process moves to Planning and Design, where the UX/UI designers create wireframes and mockups for the app layout. After this, the project proceeds to Coding, followed by a test run to ensure the software functions correctly before handing it over to the client.

This service encompasses the essential phases of design, development, testing, and deployment. Sofgen boasts a large team of 50+ skilled software engineers. Resources are divided according to project needs to achieve effective outcomes. Our models include project-based and dedicated resource-based approaches, focusing on sectors like finance and banking, healthcare, retail and e-commerce, telecommunications, manufacturing, and startup software companies. While primarily working offshore, Sofgen also offers onsite and nearshore outsourcing models.
