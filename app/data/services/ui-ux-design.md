UI Design (User Interface) focuses on the visual aspects of a product. This includes arranging elements like buttons, menus, icons, text, and colors to create an intuitive and appealing product interface that reflects the brand’s identity. For example, designing the checkout page of an app with clear buttons, easy-to-read fonts, and attractive colors.

UX Design (User Experience Design) centers on how users interact with a product. It aims to ensure a smooth, efficient, and satisfying user journey by addressing user needs and problems through well-planned features and workflows. UX design involves research, planning, testing, and ongoing improvements to enhance usability. For instance, in an e-commerce app, UX design defines the steps in the checkout process—such as adding items to the cart, entering shipping details, and completing payment—to create a fast and straightforward user experience.
