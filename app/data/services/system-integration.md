This service is largely useful for companies looking to enhance their existing software systems. For example, a retail store may want to integrate its Point of Sale (POS) system with its inventory management software to prevent stock shortages. Previously, staff had to manually update inventory after each sale, leading to delays and errors. With integration, the POS system automatically transmits sales data to the inventory software, updating stock levels in real-time. This ensures the store always knows its stock levels, avoids over-selling, and reduces manual effort. 

At Sofgen, the team provides dedicated project-based support to streamline this process, offering hourly billing or monthly payment for all materials.
