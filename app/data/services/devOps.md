DevOps is designed to enhance collaboration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It focuses on securing databases, managing data, and ensuring privacy and security.

## DevOps vs Traditional Software Development

| Aspect | DevOps | Traditional Development |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Collaboration | Developers & Operations work together | Separate teams and responsibilities |
| Deployment Frequency | Frequent (multiple releases daily) | Infrequent (monthly/quarterly) |
| Automation | High (CI/CD pipelines, IaC) | Limited |
| Response to Issues | Faster recovery and rollbacks | Slower due to manual processes |
| Scalability | Highly scalable (cloud-native) | Limited scalability |
